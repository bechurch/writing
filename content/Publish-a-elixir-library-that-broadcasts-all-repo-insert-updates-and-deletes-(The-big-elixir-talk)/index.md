show how pattern matching and genservers can make for a robust notification system

create a library from this that makes this functionality easy.

this library would extend repos function to `Broadcast.Repo.insert` or `Repo.broadcast_insert` or somethingâ€¦.

this library could also use a macro to help define the genserver in a much easier way. perhaps

```
# mix.exs
extra_applications = [..., :simple_listener]

# listeners/something.ex
defmodule SomeOnesListener do
  use SimpleListener
  
  def handle_info(%Appointment{}, :update, %{...} = new, %{...} = old) do
    # ...
  end
  def handle_info(%Appointment{}, :insert, %{...} = new, _old) do
    # ...
  end
end
```

you could show how one genserver to house your notifications is easy but you can easily expand it to be a genserver per notification type.
