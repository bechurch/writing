\## TODOs

Move mentors to bottom

Move noah shout out to the bottom

\## Draft 1

I want to take a break from teaching people how to code and talk about how I learned to be the engineer I am. (This ties directly into hiring but not in the way you expect; trust me).

My career is still begining but so far my best mentors have all been female.

Aurora taught me the value of clarity in code and the value of documentation. Always write for your future self or coworkers.

Brooklyn first showed me the power of functional programming in addition to how to approach code thoughtfully, collaboratively, and most importantly as a team. If you hire people who are curious and focused on quality it’s hard to go wrong both as a group and in the code.

Bethany gave me a great model of how to manage effectively, how to really approach the craft from the principals of relationships and clear, direct communication of expectations.

This is why when I learned typical hiring messaging discourages minority groups I became frustrated. By not taking into account how different groups respond to hard requirements we are making my experiance, i.e. great mentorship an outlier and not the norm. This is stupid.

How ever I was fortunate enough to sit with Noah Warder at SendWithUs and talk hiring pipelines. I humbly learned a lot, specifically about hard requirements and how damaging they are to the quality of your inbound applicants.

White males apply to a job position when they meet x% of the requirements

Females apply to a job position when they meet y% of requirements.

That simple math means for every hard requirement you add you are reducing the number of qualified candidates that are applying.

For no gain.

Hard year or qualifications requirements are useless. absolutely useless.

Aptitude trumps qualification and someones 1 year with python is not the same as the next. I’ve met people who had 6 years with javascript who when tested presented as someone with junior experience. And the exact inverse where someone with under a year presenting as an expert.

This is why its important when hiring to focus on what the candidate will be doing not what they’ve already done. Get to the root of it and let them decide if they can do what you need them to do. No one wants to get in over their head.

How do you do that

Lay it out in terms of 1 month, 3 month, 6 months, a year.

This is also a good way to get people inside your organization to really think about and agree upon what they need to hire and what their responsibilities will be

This even helps you measure someone after you’ve hired them. Are they really a good fit for what we need?

\## Draft 2

My best mentors have all been female. This makes me lucky, this makes me an outlier and this makes me frustrated. It makes me frustrated because the typical way we structure our hiring messages as an industry non-obviously discourages many amazing engineers from even applying. A smaller pool means worse hires which means less people get the same wonderful oppourtunity I’ve had to learn under many amazing leaders and engineers.
